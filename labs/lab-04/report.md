# Lab 04 Report - Licensing

1. I added the Creative Commons license to my lab repository under LICENSE

2. The four freedoms are to run a program however you want for any reason, to study and change the program, to redistrubute the program, and to distribute copies of your modified program.

3. Licenses are important for software because it defines what other people are allowed to do with your software. If you didn't have a license, people wouldn't be able to use, modify, or distribute your software, thus making it not open source. The license also can be guided towards what your software's intentions are. There are different licenses that are better for community based projects for instance.

4. Similar to what was mentioned above, a project that doesn't have a license cannot be used or modified by anyone. This means you should definitely not use a project that doesn't have a license. If you did, then technically you did so without authorization, and the author of the project could potentially come after you in court for using the software without permission.

5. I do agree with the claim made in that section. The Gopher team chose not to make use of use contributions, and make the development more centralized. They also misguided that people working on the software and didn't allow some domains to use it free of charge. These acts seemed to hurt the company, and could be used to show why the open source model is a better alternative.

6. Android generally seems to be an open, available to anyone type of platform. For instance, it is quite easy to get an Android app on their store versus on an iPhone. The Apache 2.0 license that they use is much less restrictive than other licenses such as the LGPL license. This allows other people to modify and use the code as they see fit, and for that reason, they decided to go with Apache 2.0.
