# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

## 1. Join the Discord if you haven't already

## 2. Reading assignments - make sure to reflect on these in your lab report

1. Most of the rules of the Open Source Definition involve making sure the software is easily available, accessible, and modifiable. Additionally there are rules about how the licensing works to ensure that various other conditions are being met, as well as rules to ensure there is no discrimination.
2. I definitely agree with a lot of what the article says regarding how to ask questions. I think the biggest takeaway for me would be to always do your own research before asking a question. Doing so will either solve your problem without having to ask for extra help, or it will just make you more informed when asking your question and discussing it with others. If you ask a question but have no idea what you're talking about, then it will be much harder to understand the answer.
3. One suggestion I have is to try and explain things in a way you think the person will understand. Sometimes I see answers online to forum posts and the people on there are using complicated language and terminology that the average person may not be familiar with. Another suggestion is to make sure that you are not just giving them the answer. You should give them a hint or basic help so that they can finish the rest on their own. That way they will actually learn from the experience versus just copying your answer down and moving on.
4. I think what happened to Jesse was terrible, and it seems incredibly unnecessary for the RIAA to feel threatened by him. While technically they seem to be legally allowed to do what they did, it definitely doesn't seem like it should be done. The RIAA potentially ruined his immediate future, just because Jesse wanted to learn about technology by playing around with their software. Having more open source software would certainly help prevent incidents such as this from occurring. By allowing people to analyze code for software and modify it, learning about technology is encouraged, and it also can help improve projects. If people can look at code and make a bug fix to the code, then the owner of the code could use this suggestion/fix themselves. Then users are collectively helping improve software and making technology more reliable and efficient. While you of course shouldn't steal code and pretend it's yours, it seems perfectly reasonable as a technology community to build off of each other and make all of our software better.
5. I thought it was interesting how the code sample could cover such a high percentage of regex input cases while also being very compact and efficient.

## 3. Linux

## 5. Play with Snap or Blockly

## 6. Reflection

I decided to take a look at Submitty on github. As many know, this site allows for computer science students and teachers to communicate with one another, as well as allow for grading of assigments. From looking at the code on Github, it looks like more of the software is written in Python and C++. The code also has accompanying documentation, and it's done in a way that allows an outsider to understand what the purpose behind it is. There is also some helpful comments in the code that help identify what the different blocks of the code are doing.
