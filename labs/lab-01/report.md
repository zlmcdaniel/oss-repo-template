## 2. Reading assignments - make sure to reflect on these in your lab report

1. Most of the rules of the Open Source Definition involve making sure the software is easy available, accessible, and modifiable. Additionally there are rules about how the licensing works to ensure that various other conditions are being met, as well as rules to ensure there is no discrimination.
2. I definitely agree with a lot of what the article says regarding how to ask questions. I think the biggest takeaway for me would be to always do your own research before asking a question. Doing so will either solve your problem without having to ask for extra help, or it will just make you more informed when asking your question and discussing it with others. If you ask a question but have no idea what you're talking about, then it will be much harder to understand the answer.
3. One suggestion I have is to try and explain things in a way you think the person will understand. Sometimes I see answers online to forum posts and the people on there are using complicated language and terminology that the average person may not be familiar with. Another suggestion is to make sure that you are not just giving them the answer. You should give them a hint or basic help so that they can finish the rest on their own. That way they will actually learn from the experience versus just copying your answer down and moving on.
